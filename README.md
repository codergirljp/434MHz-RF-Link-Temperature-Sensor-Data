434MHz-RF-Link-Temperature-Sensor-Data
======================================

This code is for both the receiving and transmitting ends of a one way RF link to wirelessly transmit temperature sensor data using an Arduino based board. The code was written for use with an Arduino Micro or Trinket (Transmitter) and Arduino Mega (Receiver) but can easily be modified for other Arduino compatible boards.
